"""Orchestration. One public method = one tool. Paid fires: pending BEFORE fire, commit only on
ledger evidence of NEW media, never an automatic second fire. fire_* and sweep settle results
through ONE helper (_settle) so a swept result gets exactly the checks a live one gets.

Order inside every fire: validate args -> TabLock (one driver of the SHARED Flow tab, across the MCP
server and flow_fire) -> RunLock (one writer per project, across processes) ->
(clips only) lint stamp -> _gate / fire_ready -> begin_fire -> fire -> settle -> release. Nothing is
written to pending before the lock and the stamp pass. sweep holds the same lock.

WAVES (queue=True): the same steps up to and including the click, then pump only until Flow has
ACCEPTED the fire - Flow-side evidence only: a new media record for this prompt in the ledger, or the
project grid growing (a new tile / a new progress %). The prompt box empties ~50 ms after ANY click
and is never evidence. Bounded ACCEPT_S. Accepted -> the attempt stays pending with queued_at and the
call returns QUEUED; settle() later commits it through _settle once its media carry a URL. Not
accepted -> unconfirmed, never re-fired. A FlowError raised after the click is tagged
e.after_click = True (the click happened: callers must not treat it as free).

NO NAVIGATION WHILE ANYTHING IS IN FLIGHT - TAB-WIDE (live 2026-09-30: a goto 5-10 s after a click
lost 3 of 4 stills). Every project with a queued attempt pending is listed in <tab_dir>/_tab_inflight.json
(beside _tab.lock), so a peer working on ANOTHER project sees it too. While any is listed, the tab may
navigate only in an IDLE window: the newest queued fire is >= IDLE_S old AND the live grid shows no
pending-tile badge AND no idle navigation has happened yet for that newest fire (at most one reload per
idle period - a rendering clip may be past the badge-less moment). Otherwise: the next fire is prepared
in place, settle() pumps on the current page, a download needing the detail view is deferred, and
upload / sweep / open_project refuse IN_FLIGHT. A never-listed queued attempt older than LOST_S is marked
lost only after that idle reload AND with no pending badge on screen; a lost line refuses a new fire
(LOST_PENDING_RELEASE) unless reroll=True, its prompt keeps blocking SAME_PROMPT_PENDING, and media that
land late for it are claimed by it (settle judges lost attempts first)."""

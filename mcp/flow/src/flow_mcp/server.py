"""MCP wiring for Google Flow. No logic here: each tool runs the matching Service method and FastMCP
returns any exception message to Claude as a tool error.

Playwright's sync API is thread-affine, so every Service call (and the lazy Service.build) runs on
ONE dedicated worker thread - a single-worker executor, never anyio's thread pool.

Costs: stills (Nano Banana 2, Image mode) are 0 credits. Clips fire on Omni 1.1 Flash
(omni_flash) only, 12 credits per output (x count). Veo Lite is refused until its UI label and cost
are verified live. Paid fires are NEVER retried automatically: an UNCONFIRMED fire stays pending
until flow_sweep settles it."""
